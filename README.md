# IntoBlue
IntoBlue is a project designed to enable cloud control of [McIntosh Labs](http://www.mcintoshlabs.com) audio equipment over wireless connections. Control of an MA5200 from two web browsers can be seen in this [video]( https://youtu.be/zQ3S4JUxpOc). All of the source material required to build and/or extend IntoBlue can be found in this repository. The files are briefly described below.
